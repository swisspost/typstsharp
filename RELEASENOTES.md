# Release Notes

## [Unreleased]
### Fixed
- Fixed an input path in a subfolder aborting the process instead of compiling. The path was handed to Typst verbatim, and a Typst virtual path only accepts forward slashes, so on Windows an ordinary relative path such as `templates\letter.typ` panicked inside a native call and took the host process down with it. Paths are now resolved against the project root before being converted, and a path that genuinely leaves the root reports an error instead of panicking.

### Added
 - Added `compiler.CompileToDocument(...)`, returning a disposable `TypstDocument` that exposes the rendered output while it is still in the memory the native library allocated. `GetOutputSpan`, `OpenOutputStream`, `CopyOutputTo`, `WriteOutputToFile` and `RentOutput` read it without putting a multi-megabyte PDF on the large object heap; `GetOutputBytes` copies when a `byte[]` is what you need.
 - Added easier PDF compilation APIs on `TypstCompiler`:
   - `compiler.CompilePdf(...)` returning a `PdfResult` (with implicit conversion to `byte[]`, `ReadOnlySpan<byte>`, and `ReadOnlyMemory<byte>`).
   - `compiler.CompilePdf(string outputFile)` / `compiler.CompilePdfAsync(string outputFile)` for direct file saving.
   - `compiler.CompilePdf(Stream destination)` / `compiler.CompilePdfAsync(Stream destination)` for stream output.
   - Static `TypstCompiler.CompilePdf(...)` and `TypstCompiler.CompilePdfFromFile(...)` for quick one-line compilations.
   - `compiler.CompileSvg(...)` and `compiler.CompilePng(...)` for format-specific image export.
   - `outcome.AsPdf()` and `outcome.PrimaryBuffer` on `CompileOutcome`.
- Added `includeSystemPackages` to `TypstCompiler`. Setting it to `false` resolves packages from `packagePath` only, so an import that is not vendored there fails instead of being downloaded from Typst Universe and compilation stays off the network.
- Added support for compiling Typst documents with multiple PDF standards simultaneously (e.g. `v-1.7`, `a-2b`, etc.) by exposing a `pdfStandards` parameter in the `TypstCompiler.Compile` API, leveraging the underlying `typst-pdf` crate updates in Typst 0.15.

### Changed
- `compiler.CompilePdf(Stream)`, `compiler.CompilePdfAsync(Stream)`, `compiler.CompilePdf(string outputFile)` and `compiler.CompilePdfAsync(string outputFile)` now stream the document straight from native memory to the destination and return the compiler warnings, rather than returning a `PdfResult` that had to be materialised on the managed heap first. Use `compiler.CompilePdf()` when you want the bytes.
- `compiler.Compile(outputFile, format)` and `compiler.CompileSvg(...)` no longer copy the rendered output onto the managed heap before writing or decoding it.
